                The greatest, most intense, enduring, and emotional journeys I've ever had the pleasure of resting my eyes on. An absolute masterpiece, subsequently fitted with an immersive narrative that pulls the player in as time progresses. It creates a relationship, relating to not only characters within the game, but the player him/herself, allowing an action-packed adventure that seems so long yet concise.

                    This game could quite literally be the best game of out generation, not many games get such high praise but this game unequivocally deserves it. Is breath taking graphics and unbeatable gameplay are only a page in a massive book on things why this game is amazing.

                    One of the best free games of all time. Marvel Rivals has really taken the world by storm in 2025! Honestly one of the biggest pleasant game surprises in my opinion.
